# Sorting Algorithm Racer
This is a simple C++ project designed for fun to experiment with various sorting algorithms. The goal is to compare their performance in sorting a randomly generated vector of unique integers.

## The project currently includes the following algorithms:

- Quick Sort
- Stable Sort
- Heap Sort
- Bubble Sort

## Features
Algorithm Selection: Select an algorithm by name (e.g., "quick sort", "bubble sort") from a mapped list of available algorithms.
Performance Measurement: The time taken for each algorithm to sort the data is measured and displayed.
Random Data Generation: A pool of unique random numbers is generated for sorting.

## How to Run
This project was developed and tested using Visual Studio 2022. To run it:

- Clone the repository.
- Open the project in Visual Studio.
- Build and run the project.
- Observe the results in the console, including the algorithm used and the sorting time.

## Example Output
```sh
Algorithm name: quick sort
Info: fast boi
Sorted <10000> in 0.00321 seconds.
```

## Future Improvements
- Add more sorting algorithms (e.g., Merge Sort, Insertion Sort).
- <del>Improve input handling for custom algorithms. </del>
- <del>Implement multi-threaded race conditions for sorting algorithms. </del>
- <del>Add Google Test and implement some unit tests. </del>
